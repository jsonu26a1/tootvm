# tootvm
 toot virtual machine

# scope
the scope is intended to be small. no JIT, just bytecode interpretation.
the language syntax will support dynamic typing (like python, js), but there
will be some form of type system, to help detect bugs before they occur in runtime.
eventually, I want to build a GUI library, and start working on an IDE for
inspecting and debugging the VM.

I want to add features for graphing and data processing/analysis, sort of like
what jupyter notebooks or matlab do. I could also add tools for interfacing with
OS (file/networking to start) and hardware (wifi, power/temps).
